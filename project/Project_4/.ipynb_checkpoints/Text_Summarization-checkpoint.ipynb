      "BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - With interest rates sky-high and the economy heading for recession, Argentina's President Mauricio Macri is running short of options to stem a slide in the peso, economists say, leaving the battered currency at the mercy of volatility in emerging markets.\n",
      "Macri's government has already taken a series of measures to restore confidence in the peso since it came under pressure in May, reviving memories of a painful 2002 economic crisis in Latin America's third-largest economy. \n",
      "The peso, which has fallen around 40 percent so far this year, rivals the Turkish lira as the world's worst performing currency in 2018. \n",
      "Argentina's central bank hiked interest rates to 40 percent in May, and Macri sealed a $50-billion deal with the International Monetary Fund in June - removing the need for outside funding and briefly steadying the peso. His government has since announced more than $2 billion in budget savings. \n",
      "But jitters returned in recent weeks as Turkey's financial crisis roiled emerging markets, after Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan clashed with U.S. President Donald Trump. Emerging market investors were already unnerved by the U.S.-China trade tensions and the Federal Reserve's tightening.\n",
      "Confidence in Argentina was also shaken by a major corruption scandal in the construction sector, expected to damage economic growth already hit by a drought that crippled vital agricultural production.\n",
      "The peso has tumbled 8.5 percent against the dollar in the past two weeks despite Argentina's central bank again hiking rates to 45 percent. On Wednesday, the bank was forced to sell $781 million in reserves to support the peso, before tightening reserve requirements a day later.\n",
      "Such dizzying interest rates and the fiscal measures would normally be enough to halt a currency run but sentiment was being dictated by global events, said Alberto Bernal, chief strategist at XP Investments in New York.\n",
      "\"Seventy percent of the problems facing Argentina are external in nature,\" Bernal said. \"Macri needs luck ... He needs Trump to go easier against China and Europe. He needs Erdogan to come to his senses and he needs a weaker dollar, which means he needs the U.S. Federal reserve to be a little less aggressive in its policy guidelines.\"\n",
      "While economists are urging Turkey's Erdogan to adopt a series of policy measures to restore confidence in the economy - including strengthening central bank independence, raising interest rates and fiscal tightening - business-friendly Macri has already announced many of these.\n",
      "A major challenge for Argentina is that interest rate rises have limited impact in fighting inflation because consumers and businesses use little credit after years of financial crises, economists say. Inflation jumped to 31 percent in June.\n",
      "Last year, private sector credit made up just 16 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in Argentina, compared to 113 percent in neighboring Chile, according to World Bank figures.\n",
      "Similarly, on the fiscal front Macri's options are limited. He has already suspended a reduction in soy export taxes and unveiled other fiscal measures worth around $2.2 billion in savings.\n",
      "Yet a weakening economy leaves Macri with few policy levers to pull without inflicting further damage. Despite high expectations at the start of 2018, the currency crisis and drought have slammed Argentina's $640 billion economy into reverse.\n",
      "After growing 3.6 percent in the first quarter, the economy shrank 5.8 percent in May when the crisis struck, according to official statistics. It is due to re-enter recession in the third quarter, economists say, only two years after it returned to growth. \n",
      "With Macri expected to seek a second four-year term next year, major spending cuts and tax rises are politically unpalatable. \n",
      "Diego Ferro, partner and portfolio manager at Greylock Capital in New York, said that until recently investors had been happy with Argentina's gradualist approach, but market turmoil had made them impatient for results from Macri's government.\n",
      "“They have shown that they are on the right path and under normal circumstances this would be enough,\" said Ferro. \"But after the disappointments they have suffered and the overall concern about emerging markets, it might not yet be enough to prompt a turnaround in the market.\"\n",
      "POLITICAL PRESSURES \n",
      "Some investors are also concerned that political pressures in Argentina will make it difficult to implement reforms. The changes to soy taxes have already proven unpopular with the farm lobby, a key base of his support.\n",
      "Riot police were needed to control demonstrators in December when Congress passed pension changes. Unions have protested over planned labor reforms that have now stalled in the legislature, where there is resistance to the fiscal tightening required by the IMF deal.\n",
      "Macri agreed with the Fund to cut Argentina's fiscal deficit from 3.7 percent of gross domestic product last year to 2.7 percent in 2018 and 1.3 percent in 2019. \n",
      "Many ordinary Argentines blame Macri for worsening inflation after cuts to public utility subsidies - a key plank of his economic platform - drove water and heating bills higher.\n",
      "Macri admitted on Friday that poverty would rise this year because of high inflation.\n",
      "\"He's very constrained because of the social tensions that are blowing up due to the slowing economy,\" said Buenos Aires-based economist Gustavo Ber.\n",
      "Economists expect the economy to contract 0.3 percent this year and grow 1.5 percent next year, according to the most recent central bank survey.\n",
      "Macri has defended his gradual approach to reform, saying it was needed to shelter ordinary Argentines from a drop in living standards.\n",
      "Yet for some, Macri squandered an opportunity for sweeping change after he was elected in 2015 amid frustration with outgoing President Cristina Fernandez's administration of 12 years of leftist rule.\n",
      "\"Macri is doing the right things but he's doing them two years too late,\" said Guillermo Nielsen, an economist and former finance secretary in the left-leaning government of Nestor Kirchner. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"He did not make the changes that the Argentine economy needed to get back to growth,\" he said. \"I don't see Argentina coming back anytime soon.\"\n",

      "ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece will be more tightly monitored after it exits its bailout program than other euro zone countries that received similar loans, the head of the bloc's rescue mechanism told a Greek newspaper on Sunday.\n",
      "Athens is set to exit its latest bailout on Aug. 20 and rely on bond markets thereafter to refinance its debt after a near nine-year debt crisis that shrank its economy by a quarter and forced it to implement painful austerity measures.\n",
      "\"Greece is exceptional. It has received much more loans from us than any other country,\" European Stability Mechanism (ESM) Managing Director Klaus Regling told Ethnos newspaper in an interview.\n",
      "Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Cyprus, which borrowed from the ESM, were also monitored after the end of their assistance programs.\n",
      "\"No other program country has received anything comparable. Therefore, the monitoring will be tighter than in the other cases and this will take the form of the so-called enhanced surveillance,\" he said.\n",
      "Since its debt crisis erupted in early 2010, Greece has relied on the biggest bailout in economic history, more than 260 billion euros lent by its euro zone partners and the IMF.\n",
      "Regling told the paper that enhanced surveillance, which was agreed by the European Commission in July, aims to ensure there will be no backtracking on reforms and the fiscal path agreed with Greece's lenders.\n",
      "Under the tight monitoring, officials from European institutions including the ESM will visit Athens every three months for an assessment.\n",
      "\"As Greece's biggest creditor by far, the ESM also wants to make sure that we will be repaid. We are a very patient creditor. But we do want to be repaid. So we will follow developments in Greece very closely,\" Regling said.\n",
      "Regling said he got \"a lot of extra gray hair\" in the summer of 2015 - the toughest period of the nine-year debt crisis - given the big clash between the leftist-led Greek government and its euro zone partners which led Athens to the brink of crashing out of the euro.\n",
      "But, he said, Greece can be a \"success story\" just like Portugal, Spain, Ireland and Cyprus as long as it continues to work on restoring its partners' trust.\n",
      "\"(The end of the bailout) is great news! The Greek people should celebrate. From my visits to Athens, I have come to really appreciate Greek wines. But tomorrow, I will celebrate it with a good glass of ouzo,\" Regling told the paper.\n",

      "원문 :  (Bloomberg Opinion) -- Analysts are trying urgently to evaluate the potential impact of a full-fledged trade war on the Chinese economy. This typically involves estimating how much various tariff scenarios will reduce China’s GDP growth, with current estimates ranging from the minimal, 0.1 or 0.2 percentage points, to the substantial -- as much as 2 percentage points.\n",
      "This is probably the right way to evaluate the impact of external shocks on other countries. For China, however, it’s wholly inappropriate. The fact is that Chinese GDP will be unaffected by a trade war with the U.S., no matter how severe, because the government will do whatever it takes to meet its growth targets.\n",
      "That doesn’t mean higher tariffs won’t damage the Chinese economy. The pain will instead show up instead mainly in the form of a more rapid rise in debt. The harsher the war’s impact, in other words, the more debt China will need to achieve its growth target.\n",
      "China’s Debt Bomb\n",
      "To understand why, one needs to appreciate the difference between GDP growth as a system output and as a system input. In most economies, GDP is a measure of output generated by the economy. At the end of every period, during which the economy does what it does subject to standard economic constraints, government statisticians measure the relevant changes in activity and this is reported as the amount by which GDP expanded or contracted.\n",
      "This isn’t what happens in China, as even Chinese leaders will occasionally admit. In China, the government sets the GDP growth rate early in the year at a level thought adequate to accommodate its social and political objectives, among which is to keep unemployment low. The political nature of the target modifies the standard economic constraints, encouraging local governments to generate whatever additional economic activity is required so that, along with the economic activity of the private and real-estate sectors, the target is reached (within a few tenths of a percentage point).\n",
      "Two factors unique to China are critical for this system to work. First, till now local governments haven’t been subject to hard budget constraints. They can engage in near-unlimited amounts of non-productive economic activity unconstrained by worries about remaining solvent.\n",
      "Second, and necessary for the first, local governments control most credit creation within the banking system. Because such loans are directly or indirectly guaranteed, banks don’t have to write down loans when the projects they fund cannot service the debt. This allows the banks to extend as much new credit as local governments need to meet their targets.\n",
      "If, as is widely acknowledged even by the government, the amount of debt written down in every period is less than the amount of non-economic loans extended during that period, recorded GDP growth will rise, regardless of whether the underlying economy can or can’t generate enough activity on its own.\n",
      "As long as China has debt capacity, and the government is willing to use it, China can achieve any GDP growth target it wants. Thus, while GDP numbers may tell us something about the government’s social and political priorities, they’re a poor measure of the underlying performance of the economy. They tell us even less about the impact of trade war on the Chinese economy.\n",
      "This doesn’t mean there’s no way to evaluate the adverse impact of a trade conflict. As any systems analyst knows, while an input can never tell you anything about the performance of a system, an output can. What analysts need to examine is the appropriate output data, such as the amount of new credit needed to generate additional economic activity. This will show how much unproductive activity is required to reach the growth target. \n",
      "There’s one silver lining. Chinese leaders seem determined to get debt under control, which will ultimately require either giving up the growth target or lowering it considerably. A trade war, then, could be used politically, to overcome internal resistance to allowing GDP to slow. Pain is inevitable. The only question is whether China seeks to hide it, or use it to its long-term advantage.\n",

      "원문 :  (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. economy will be hit many times harder than the rest of the world by an escalating global trade war, according the the chief executive officer of A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S.\n",
      "Soren Skou, who runs the world’s biggest shipping company from Copenhagen, said the fallout of the current protectionist wave “could easily end up being bigger in the U.S.” Tariffs could slow global annual trade growth by 0.1 to 0.3 percent, though for the U.S. the effect could be “perhaps 3 or 4 percent,” he said at Maersk’s headquarters on Friday. “And that would definitely not be good.”\n",
      "The company transports about 20 percent of the world’s seaborne consumer goods, putting it in a unique position to gauge the fallout of tariffs on trade flows. Maersk has in the past broken with its culture of steering clear of any political debate to criticize the trade policies of U.S. President Donald Trump.\n",
      "Maersk focuses on trade flows between Europe and Asia and so far its industry hasn’t been directly hurt by tariffs. In fact, demand grew 4 percent in the second quarter. But Skou says that may change if the U.S. starts targeting consumer goods.\n",
      "“The first thing the American importers would do if tariffs are put on Chinese consumer goods would be to buy in Vietnam, in Indonesia or elsewhere in Asia,” Skou said. “Big U.S. consumer brands like  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) produce in all of Asia, not just in one country, so there will be a substitution effect.”\n",

      "ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - From creating 10 million jobs to building an Islamic welfare state and restoring Pakistan's tattered image abroad, new premier Imran Khan is facing a problem of his own making: runaway expectations raised by his lofty rhetoric.\n",
      "A cricket legend and firebrand nationalist who is hero-worshipped by supporters, Khan swept to power in last month's election on a populist platform vowing to root out corruption among a venal elite and lift people out of poverty.\n",
      "But he inherits control of a volatile nation facing mounting problems at home and abroad, including a looming economic crisis and a fracture with historic ally the United States over Pakistan's alleged links to militants. Ties are also fraught with neighbors Afghanistan and nuclear-armed rival India.\n",
      "Opponents in parliament talk of forming a grand coalition against Khan, dubbing him a \"puppet\" and accusing him of entering into a Faustian Pact with the powerful military, which has a history of ousting prime ministers and clashing with civilian governments over control of foreign policy.\n",
      "Khan denies all accusations that the military covertly helped him win the election.\n",
      "And in his victory speech, Khan offered an olive branch to India and called for mutually beneficial ties with the United States.\n",
      "Whether Khan can become the first Pakistani prime minister to complete a full five-year term in office will depend on his relationship with influential generals, analysts say.\n",
      "If his ideas on foreign policy differ from theirs, analysts say Khan would suffer a similar fate to other civilian leaders who have failed to see out their term.\n",
      "\"Then his future will be the same as anybody else's,\" political commentator Aamer Ahmed Khan said.\n",
      "GREAT EXPECTATIONS\n",
      "Forced to rely on smaller parties for a razor-thin majority in parliament, and with the opposition controlling the Senate, Khan's coalition government could struggle to push through legislation without major compromises. An increasingly assertive judiciary could also hold it back.\n",
      "Yet the mood in the country is one of unbridled optimism, especially among Khan's young supporters, who believe he can build a corruption-free and prosperous \"New Pakistan\" for the country's 208 million people.\n",
      "\"His biggest challenge is managing expectations among his followers and voters because he's almost promised them the moon,\" said Raza Ahmad Rumi, the editor of Pakistan's Daily Times newspaper.\n",
      "During Independence Day celebrations this week, when flag-waving Pakistanis flooded the streets of Islamabad, many voiced confidence that Khan would deliver on promises to build world class hospitals and improve education in a nation where the illiteracy rate hovers above 40 percent.\n",
      "\"I have moved my daughter (from a private) to a government school, because we are confident that Pakistan is going to change,\" said Sheikh Farhaj, 40, who volunteered for Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party during the elections.\n",
      "Others were delighted Khan has broken the decades-long dominance of the two dynastic powerhouses, the outgoing Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party of jailed former premier Nawaz Sharif and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) of the Bhutto family.\n",
      "\"We have great expectations from Imran Khan,\" said Shah Sultan, 38, a roadside flag seller. \"We are lower class people and I voted from Khan because what the politicians have done to our country. They have left it with nothing.\"\n",
      "LOOMING ECONOMIC CRISIS\n",
      "But Khan's campaign pledges are likely to be checked by a worsening economic outlook, analysts say, especially his vow to build a welfare state.\n",
      "The central bank has devalued the rupee four times since December, but the current account deficit is still carrying the currency toward a crisis, while the fiscal deficit has ballooned to 6.8 percent of GDP.\n",
      "Economic growth is running at nearly 6 percent, but given the unsustainability of these deficits it is easy to predict Pakistan's growth is heading for a fall.\n",
      "Khan's government must urgently decide whether to request more loans from China, deepening Islamabad's economic reliance on its neighbor, or ask the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for what would be its 15th bailout since 1980.\n",
      "Both lenders are likely to ask for more fiscal discipline, requiring drastic spending cuts.\n",
      "Shafqat Mahmood, Khan's new education minister, said the economic woes pose a major problem but the party is determined to deliver a welfare system and enact badly-needed reforms.\n",
      "\"Everyone in the party realizes we will have to work overtime to meet these huge expectations,\" Mahmood said.\n",
      "Mahmood said Khan's image as a politician untainted by corruption could boost faith in the government and convince more people to file taxes in a nation where less than 1 percent of the population pays income tax.\n",
      "Khan has touted his \"100 Day Plan\" but many of the reforms PTI is proposing, from turning around loss-making state-run enterprises to reforming the tax collection bureau, will take far longer to accomplish. \n",
      "Ending government corruption outright, or repatriating plundered wealth, is also unlikely.\n",
      "\"(Khan's supporters) have a simplistic idea that if there is a clean man on top, the entire machinery becomes clean. That's never the case anywhere in the world,\" said Rumi.\n",

      "PUNTO FIJO/SAN CRISTOBAL, Venezuela (Reuters) - After Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's 60-fold increase to the minimum wage, storeowners on Saturday wrestled with an anguishing decision: Close up shop or hit customers with steep price hikes at the risk of sinking the business.\n",
      "In a set of sweeping announcements that shocked many Venezuelans, the socialist Maduro on Friday ordered a 96 percent currency devaluation, pegged the bolivar currency to the government's petro cryptocurrency and boosted taxes as part of a plan aimed at pulling the OPEC member out of its economic tailspin.\n",
      "The measures especially spooked shopkeepers already struggling to stay afloat due to hyperinflation, government-set prices for goods ranging from flour to diapers, and strict currency controls that crimp imports. Many stores were closed on Saturday as owners hunkered down to consider the implications.\n",
      "Economists warned that some companies would go under, unable to shoulder the massive increase in monthly minimum wage from 3 million bolivars to 180 million bolivars, or roughly $0.5 to $30. That will likely increase unemployment and further fuel mass emigration that has overwhelmed neighboring South American countries.\n",
      "Jhonny Herrera, 41, owner of a hardware store on the windswept Paraguana Peninsula in northern Venezuela, said he would have to fire two employees because he cannot afford to pay them, leaving him with just one worker. When Venezuela was enjoying a decade-long oil bonanza, he had 10 employees.\n",
      "\"I have thought about closing for good and leaving, all the more so now with these increases. I have held back due to my 14 year-old-son, who I would leave here because I need to emigrate first,\" said Herrera, surrounded by stores that have been shuttered after their owners fled the country.\n",
      "To soften the blow, Maduro vowed that the government would cover three months of the wage increase for small and medium-sized companies. But he did not provide details and it remains unclear how his cash-starved government would afford such a hefty payout or whether the chaotic administration has the logistical capacity to pay wages on time.\n",
      "The Information Ministry did not respond to a request for an explanation of the plan. Venezuela's opposition called for protests and a national strike on Tuesday, although\n",
      "recent attempts by the fractured coalition to rally Venezuelans have had little impact.\n",
      "Venezuela's main business chamber, Fedecamaras, said it did not have any estimates on the effects of the measure yet, although local economists predicted a heavy toll.\n",
      "\"A minimum wage of 180 million bolivars in this current situation implies the closure of thousands of companies and the unemployment of many people,\" said economist Luis Oliveros.\n",
      "Bakery owner Luis Carballo, a 59-year-old who has worked in the bread sector for 45 years, said he would try to stay afloat but was full of dread.\n",
      "\"I have to increase prices ... And if I don't sell, production drops, and I have to suspend some of my employees. I feel really badly,\" said Carballo, as he handed loaves to customers in the Andean city of San Cristobal.\n",

      "원문 :  ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece's central bank governor warned the country not to backtrack on commitments to its lenders after it exits the last of its three bailouts next week, saying markets would abandon it.\n",
      "Yannis Stournaras told Sunday's Kathimerini newspaper any backpedalling could leave Greece facing major risks at a time when it would be particularly vulnerable to financial turbulence in neighboring Turkey, Italy and beyond.\n",
      "Athens is set to exit its latest bailout on Aug. 20 and rely on bond markets thereafter to refinance its debt after a nearly nine-year debt crisis that shrank its economy by a quarter and forced it to implement painful austerity.\n",
      "\"If we backtrack on what we have agreed, now or in the future, the markets will abandon us and we will not be able to refinance maturing loans on sustainable-debt terms,\" Bank of Greece Governor Yannis Stournaras told the paper.\n",
      "Since the debt crisis exploded in early 2010, four successive governments fought to keep bankruptcy at bay, relying on the biggest bailout in economic history, more than 260 billion euros lent by Greece's euro zone partners and the IMF.\n",
      "Shut out of bond markets after a fiscal derailment, Greece officially asked for a bailout in April 2010 with the International Monetary Fund and its euro zone partners granting 110 billion euros in loans to avert a financial meltdown. Two more aid packages followed.\n",
      "Athens returned to sovereign debt markets in July 2017 with a 3.0 billion euro bond sale that marked a milestone in its return to economic health.\n",
      "\"If there is strong international turbulence, either in our neighboring Italy or Turkey or in the global economy, we will face difficulties in tapping markets given that the sensitivity coefficient of Greek bonds remains high,\" Stournaras said.\n",
      "But this, the second risk, is more manageable, he said, and should wane as long as markets become convinced that Greece is pursuing the right economic policy and keeping its promises.\n",
      "\"Let's not forget the euro zone still has gaps in its architecture. The banking union has not been completed, thus any convulsion affects its weaker member-states more,\" he said.\n",
      "Post–bailout, Athens has committed to attain demanding primary budget surpluses - excluding debt servicing outlays - of 3.5 percent of GDP until 2022, and 2.2 percent until 2060.\n",
      "French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told Greek newspaper To Vima that the goal of Greece's economic adjustment programme was the country's return to normality and that its bailout exit is a \"great success.\"\n",
      "But the agreed commitments must be adhered to. \n",
      "\n",
