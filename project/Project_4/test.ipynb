      "OPEC cut its forecast of Russian output by 530,000 bpd, although it raised its forecast for U.S. tight oil, another term for shale. Even so, world oil consumption is expected to surpass the 100 million bpd mark in the third quarter, as OPEC has predicted. At its last meeting, OPEC+ swerved the Ukraine war, which Russia refers to as a \"special military operation\", and stuck to a previously agreed plan to boost its monthly output target by 432,000 bpd in May.\n",

      "(Bloomberg) -- OPEC sees Russia’s invasion of Ukraine curtailing both world oil demand and supply, indicating little need for the group to divert from its current production policy. The OPEC+ coalition has instead stuck with a policy of restoring output halted during the pandemic in modest tranches of roughly 400,000 barrels a day, though most of its 23 members are struggling to make the increases agreed. OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo told the European Union on Monday that the oil market was beyond its control.\n",

      "Both crude benchmarks recorded their second consecutive lower week last week, pressured by the news that International Energy Agency member countries agreed to release 60 million barrels of crude from their emergency reserves, adding to the 180 million barrel release the U.S. announced in March. If confirmed, this would only put further pressure on the EU to target Russian oil imports.”\n",
      "The gains have been slightly reduced following the release of the latest U.S. consumer price data, which surged 1.2% in March, the biggest monthly gain since September 2005. OPEC will update its forecasts for global supply and demand in its monthly report, the U.S. will release its Short-Term Energy Outlook, while the American Petroleum Institute will report its weekly estimate for U.S. crude stocks.\n",

      "The revision, which followed an upward reassessment of petrochemicals demand in China and Saudi Arabia back to 2007, leads to a view that the oil market is tighter than previously thought, increasing the argument OPEC should try to increase output more quickly, analysts said. That has exacerbated OPEC+ concern the IEA was ignoring the extent of continued demand in the medium term, the sources say, and OPEC+ bridled at the IEA request for extra oil to lower prices to suit the West when it considered the market was adequately supplied. Against this backdrop, an OPEC+ technical discussion that lasted over six hours in March ended with a unanimous decision to eliminate the International Energy Agency's (IEA) numbers when assessing the state of the oil market.\n",

      "Before the new wave of sanctions was introduced, Russia had said it would continue implementation of its energy projects, including Arctic LNG 2. Alexei Grivach of the Moscow-based National Energy Security Fund said that Russian LNG production is \"critically\" reliant on imports. \"The ban... jeopardises the energy strategy until 2035, according to which Russia's share in the global LNG market was to reach 20%,\" the Aton brokerage wrote in a note.\n",

      "Investing.com – Gold was up on Tuesday morning in Asia as U.S. Treasury yields and the dollar gained ahead of the latest inflation figures.

The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield also rose on Monday to its highest in more than three years.\n",

      "Meanwhile, OPEC warned that losses from Russian oil and other liquids exports due to existing sanctions could be as much as seven million barrels per day. Both Brent and WTI contracts settled down around 4% on Monday as COVID-19 lockdowns in China drove fuel demand concerns and the International Energy Agency prepares a massive oil reserve release. \"Oil prices will play tug-of-war here as crude inventories remain low, but energy traders will struggle to shake off these steady announcements of new COVID restrictions in China,\" the note added.\n",

      "“Gold should continue to see strong inflows as uncertainty over inflation and growth will remain elevated over the coming months due to geopolitics and differing views on how aggressive the Fed will need to be with tightening of monetary policy during the summer months,” said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at Oanda Corp.\n",

      "NEW DELHI/MUMBAI/BANGALORE (Reuters) -India's HDFC Bank and some foreign banks have stopped offering trade credit for oil imports to Nayara Energy, a Russian-backed refiner, and some suppliers are seeking payment upfront to avoid potential problems resulting from western sanctions against Moscow, four banking and industry sources said. To avoid the need for credit to fund overseas trade, the Mumbai-headquartered company is selling more of its refined fuels in India, two of the sources said. \"Since these LCs are routed via overseas banks in the countries that have placed the sanction, we don't want to take the chance of spoiling our working relationships, so in some cases we end up taking a more cautious approach,\" an executive director at an Indian state-owned bank said.\n",

Funds have been sellers in four of the last five weeks reducing their overall net long position by the equivalent of 188 million barrels since the start of March, according to exchange and regulatory records. Hedge funds and other money managers sold the equivalent of 11 million barrels in the six most important petroleum-related futures and options contracts in the week to April 5.\n",

The EU expects its oil use to decrease 30% by 2030, from 2015 levels, under its planned policies to fight climate change - though in the short term, an embargo would trigger a dash to replace Russian oil with alternative supplies. European Union officials held talks in Vienna with representatives of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries amid calls for the group to increase output and as the EU considers potential sanctions on Russian oil.\n",

      "Investing.com – Oil prices started the week on the back foot Monday, as Covid-19 lockdowns in China dimmed the outlook for demand at a time when IEA member countries and the U.S. are set to release millions of barrels of oil. The lockdown in China has hurt travel activity in the world's second largest economy, putting jet-fuel and broader oil demand in a chokehold. The consulting firm FGE forecasts the impact of declining transport demand in a range of 1.2 million to 1.3 million barrels per day in total, with jet fuel demand accounting for half of this figure, {{Commerzbank added.}}\n",
